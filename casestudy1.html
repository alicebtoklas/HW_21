              <p>WellRead is mobile app case study based on qualitative user research that aims to connect readers with critically-acclaimed books through local community-based resources. 
              Our team consisted of five UX designers, and we all worked collaboratively on each stage of the design process. 
              I brought my background in qualitative research and literary studies into play to help develop a user research plan, interview script, survey questions, and an intituitve information architecture.</p> 
              <p>Tools used: Figma, Miro, Trello, G-Suite.</p>
              <p>Key deliverables: user research plan, user interview script, user interview transcripts, research synthesis (affinity diagram, prioritization matrix, value proposition matrix), competitor analysis, user persona & protopersona, storyboard, sketch wireframes, clickable wireframe prototype, hi-fidelity prototype</p>

              Our research involved a multi-pronged approach. On the one hand, we developed a greater familiarity with the current market for reading apps through competitor analysis. 
              On the other, we focused on understanding and empathizing with our users through qualitative methods such as interviews and surveys. 
              Our first priority was hearing directly from our users, and we were excited by the creative ways users were connecting to books! It was clear from our interviews that reading was a passionate activity, and we hoped to direct this passion in the service of building community and recuperating independent businesses.

              After collecting user data, we brainstormed to refine the problem and define possible solutions. Through affinity diagrams and priority matrices, we reached a consensus on the key features the app would include and the value these features would provide.

                <p>We compiled all the sketch wireframes to discuss their pros and cons, primarily focusing on simplicity in design, usability, and discoverability. We knew that as a new app, the onboarding experience would be important, and that if the app wasn't intuitive and clear we would likely lose potential users.</p>
                <p class="mb-0">Our usability test of our clickable mobile wireframe examined two key processes: signing up/onboarding and adding a book to the library. By testing the prototype for these basic processes, we hope to identify user pain points, points of confusion, and pleasurable experiences.</p>

                <p>Next, the fun part! We tested out fonts and added some color, prioritizing accessibility, clarity, and joy-an emotion many associate with discovering new learning materials. But as the app became more detailed, we faced another struggle: feature creep. To address this challenge, we needed to check back in about our unique value to the reading app market, our key features, and our core concerns.</p>
                <p class="mb-0">Using good books to build stronger local communities was our primary aim, but we grappled with how to integrate social features into the app. Should we include features that mirrored social media, such as likes and comments? Or should we use the social features to direct users to resources outside of the app, such as local bookstores and reading groups?</p>
                <p></p>
                <p class="mb-0">Ultimately, user's responded with the most enthusiasm to the local, community-based ethos of the app rather than to the social-media-like features that they could find in other apps. I believe that this response reflects a growing desire for our daily habits and consumer choices to better reflect our values.</p>

                  <p>We decided to prototype our app first for Android. There are more Android users than iOS users, and often there are more affordable Android options. These were important considerations for us, as we wanted our app to reach users from across economic and geographic spectrums.</p>
                  <p class="mb-0">Our prototype design stayed responsive to the usability test feedback we received on the clickable wireframes and, later, the clickable hi-fi prototype. Our usability tests alerted us to some important issues: too many and unclear features, lackluster color schemes, and unappealing font choices.</p>
                  <p>
                  <p >Each iteration of our prototype required us to simplify and refine. Ultimately, we developed a clickable hi-fi prototype that allowed users to sign in/sign up, onboard, browse reading lists, review information on a specific book, and add a book to their reading list.</p>

              <h5>Key Findings</h5>
              <p>The qualitative data we gathered from user interviews and an online survey showed that books have an important place in users' lives, regardless of which genres they tend to read. 
                  Almost eighty percent (77.8%) of our survey participants were 35 or older, showing that many older adults are keen to use technology to learn and connect. </p>

              <p>We also found that even though users sometimes experience reading as a solitary activity, they often rely on social networks to expand their reading lists: recommendations from friends and family, books mentioned in the social media posts or talks from influential thought leaders, and subthreads like BookTok.
                  We also found that geography plays a role in what books and book-finding resources are available. For example, while free libraries are now a staple of many cities and towns, suburban users have rarely encountered them, but would be interested in using them.
              </p>
              <h5>Next Steps</h5>
              <p>Because of time and group work constraints, I believe the project has many opportunities to continue refining its direction and purpose, particularly in limiting the prototype to a few key features: 1) curated critically-acclaimed book lists and 2) resources for finding these books in local and community-oriented ways. 
                  There are also opportunities to do more research into reading habits and local resources, which vary greatly by geographic location.</p>
                  <p>I'm excited about the app's potential to team up with and support local literary and social institutions such as libraries, independent bookstores, local coffee shops with free libraries, and reading groups. I was moved by the excitement and passion I heard in user interviews, and I believe WellRead has the potential to serve as an outlet for a current wave of independent creativity and to fulfill the desire to build stronger local, ethical, and sustainable networks.</p>
